#Role Based Access Control
One of the great benefits of using ARM resources are that they all support Role Based Access Control (RBAC). 

With role based access control you can grant users fine grained access to each individual resource or resource group if you want. 
Thus you no longer have to give everybody co-administrator rights if they just need to mange a single Azure Web App.

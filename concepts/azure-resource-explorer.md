#Azure Resource Explorer
Azure Resource Explorer is an interactive web site where you can browse your Azure Resource Groups and get a better understanding of how the JSON schemas looks like for your already provisioned resoruces. 

The web site, doesn't support all aspects of ARM but it a great learning and debugging tool. 

![The azure resource explorer uses the REST interface to show the JSON for all your resources](https://github.com/sjkp/azure-arm-hol/raw/master/concepts/img/azure-resource-explorer.png)
